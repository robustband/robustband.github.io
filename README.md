## Tech

The website uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Tensorflow] - Deep learning application framework
- [Scikit-Learn] - Bank for classification, predictive analytics, and very many other machine learning tasks.
- [Flask] - Framework for creating web applications in Python easier.
- [Matplotlib] - A low level graph plotting library in python that serves as a visualization utility.
- [Numpy] - Used for working with arrays
- [Pandas] - Used for data analysis and associated manipulation of tabular data in Dataframes
